# Personal Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio for displaying my projects and work. I have created this with the help of YouTube video from JavaScript Mastery. 
Initially I built the project as shown in the tutorial, however I wanted to change many things according to my preferences. 
First, I didn't like the links to all the sections of the application, So I modified the Wrapper Component according to my requirements.
Second there was no email validation or fields requirements set on the contact me section, so I added that.
Now after doing few changes, I didn't want to give users traditional browser generated alert windows, So I added the react-hot-toast library and provided messages through that to make the user experience better.
In future I want to improve this very much but for now I am keeping it like this....
